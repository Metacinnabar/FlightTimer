# FlightTimer
Flight Left Timer is a mod that counts the amount of flight time you have left. 
The amount left will be drawn by default in the center of the screen, however, you are able to change its position via mod config. 
You are also able to instantly disable it via the mod config. This mod is client-sided.
No number will be displayed when you are not flying.
